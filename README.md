# Assignment 4 of S.E. Lab (TR and UR)

This file contains the Python program files, database files and text files of the 4th assignment of Software Engineering Lab for the 2.2 semester. The python files are stored as .py files, the database files as .db and the text files as .txt files. There are a total of 3 problems given; the solutions, along with screenshots, are given to provide a smooth understanding of the workflow of the programs. These are as follows :

# 1. Inventory Management System with Git
   
a) Design a system to manage products for a store. Customers can make purchases, and
sellers can update the list of products.

b) Use Git for version control and maintain an item purchase history.

The program source code is stored as store_management.py, and the database file is stored as store.db.
The program can perform the following tasks:
1. Add product — This function adds a product, name, price, and quantity.

# 2.Marks Management System with Git
a) Develop a Student Marks Management System using Git.

b) In this system, a central database stores students' marks for different subjects in a tabular
format.

c) Subject teachers can update marks as needed before the final submission.

d) Teachers can view student names and roll numbers but only edit the marks for their
subject.

e) When all teachers have completed their updates, the database is sorted by total marks and
made available for students to view.

The program source code is stored as student_marks.py, and the database file is stored as student_marks.db.
The program can perform the following tasks:
1. Add student — This function adds a student by adding their name.

It is a simple task manager tool that does various tasks like:
1. add tasks
2. edit tasks
3. remove tasks
4. display tasks
5. mark tasks as complete

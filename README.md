# Assignment 4 of S.E. Lab (TR and UR)

This file contains the Python program files, database files and text files of the 4th assignment of Software Engineering Lab for the 2.2 semester. The python files are stored as .py files, the database files as .db and the text files as .txt files. There are a total of 3 problems given; the solutions, along with screenshots, are given to provide a smooth understanding of the workflow of the programs. These are as follows :

# 1. Inventory Management System with Git
   
a) Design a system to manage products for a store. Customers can make purchases, and

subject.

e) When all teachers have completed their updates, the database is sorted by total marks and
made available for students to view.

The program source code is stored as student_marks.py, and the database file is stored as student_marks.db.
The program can perform the following tasks:
1. Add student — This function adds a student by adding their name.
